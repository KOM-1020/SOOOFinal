# Travel-Optimized Cleaning Scheduler for Franchise 372

A comprehensive weekly scheduling system that optimizes cleaning routes using **true travel time minimization** with geographic clustering and team capacity management. Successfully schedules 183 customers across 7 days with realistic time constraints and team distribution.

## 🎯 **Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

✅ **Tuesday Issue RESOLVED** - All 27 customers properly distributed across 16 teams  
✅ **100% Coverage** - All 183 customers scheduled exactly once per week  
✅ **Geographic Clustering** - Teams work in same neighborhoods to minimize driving  
✅ **Realistic Scheduling** - No team overload, proper business hour constraints  

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **True Travel Optimization**
- **Geographic clustering** using real driving time matrices
- **Team size limits** (max 4 customers per team)
- **Sequential routing** with proper travel gaps between jobs
- **Business hour constraints** (8:30 AM - 6:00 PM operations)

### **Smart Constraints**
- **Customer availability** (Monday-Sunday scheduling preferences)
- **Team operational capacity** (16 teams available most days, 4 on Sunday)
- **Service duration handling** (90-300+ minute cleaning jobs)
- **Time validation** with automatic redistribution if teams exceed limits

### **Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Travel time metrics** for each day and team
- **Team performance breakdown** across the week
- **Efficiency ratios** (service time vs travel time)
- **Cost estimates** for travel optimization savings

## 📋 **Quick Start**

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Ensure Data Files
Required files in `data files/` folder:
- `franchise_info.csv` - Franchise configuration
- `master_cleans.csv` - Customer service durations
- `customer_profiles.csv` - Customer availability constraints
- `team_availability.csv` - Team operational status
- `complete_real_driving_time_matrix_final.csv` - Travel time matrix (183 customers)
- `complete_real_driving_distance_matrix_final.csv` - Distance matrix (183 customers)

### 3. Run the Optimizer
```bash
python optimizer.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- **Runtime**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Coverage**: 100% (all 183 customers scheduled)
- **Distribution**: 1-4 customers per team, balanced workloads
- **Schedule**: `travel_optimized_schedule_franchise_372_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

## 🎊 **Recent Major Improvements**

### **Tuesday Breakthrough (July 2025)**
**Problem Solved**: Tuesday was assigning all 27 customers to a single team, creating impossible 25+ hour schedules.

**Root Cause**: Geographic clustering algorithm was cascading - once one team got a customer, all subsequent customers saw it as the "closest" option.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Team Size Limits**: Maximum 4 customers per team prevents overloading
2. **Team-by-Team VRP**: Preserves geographic assignments from phase 1
3. **Capacity Checking**: Ensures no team exceeds business hour limits

**Results**:
- ✅ Tuesday: 27 customers across **16 teams** (1-3 per team)
- ✅ Geographic clustering: Teams work in same neighborhoods
- ✅ Realistic times: 8:30 AM - 4:20 PM (no overtime)

### **Weekly Distribution Success**
```
Monday:    33 customers across 10 teams (3.3 avg per team)
Tuesday:   27 customers across 16 teams (1.7 avg per team) ← FIXED!
Wednesday: 30 customers across 10 teams (3.0 avg per team)  
Thursday:  23 customers across  9 teams (2.6 avg per team)
Friday:    23 customers across  8 teams (2.9 avg per team)
Saturday:  40 customers across 12 teams (3.3 avg per team)
Sunday:     7 customers across  3 teams (2.3 avg per team)
```

## 🔧 **Algorithm Overview**

### **Phase 1: Geographic Clustering**
- Creates travel-optimized customer clusters (max 3 customers each)
- Uses real driving time matrix for cluster formation
- Prioritizes clusters by travel efficiency (minutes per customer)

### **Phase 2: Team Assignment with Constraints**
- Assigns clusters to day/team combinations
- Respects customer availability (Monday-Sunday preferences)
- Enforces team capacity limits (max 4 customers per team)
- Balances workload across available teams

### **Phase 3: Route Optimization**
- Optimizes route order within each team using nearest neighbor
- Creates sequential scheduling with travel gaps
- Validates business hour constraints (8:30 AM - 6:00 PM)

### **Phase 4: Time Validation**
- Redistributes customers if teams would exceed 6 PM
- Finds alternative assignments for overloaded teams
- Ensures realistic scheduling across the entire week

## 🗂️ **Data Files Structure**

### **Essential Files (in `data files/`)**
```
📁 data files/
├── franchise_info.csv (franchise configuration)
├── master_cleans.csv (customer service durations)  
├── customer_profiles.csv (availability constraints)
├── team_availability.csv (team operational status)
├── complete_real_driving_time_matrix_final.csv (183x183 travel times)

- **Format**: Customer_XXXXXXX (e.g., Customer_5413588)  
- **Units**: Time in minutes, Distance in kilometers
- **Coverage**: Mount Prospect service area (Chicago northwest suburbs)

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **In optimizer.py**
```python
USE_PRECOMPUTED_MATRICES = True   # Use existing matrices (recommended)
CLEAN_RAW_DATA = False           # Set True to rebuild from raw CSVs
RAW_DATA_FOLDER = "data files"   # Location of data files
```

### **Default Settings**
- **Franchise**: 372 (Mount Prospect)
- **Target Week**: July 8-14, 2025 (automatically set)
- **Business Hours**: 8:30 AM - 6:00 PM  
- **Team Capacity**: Max 4 customers per team
- **Available Teams**: 16 teams (most days), 4 teams (Sunday)

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"No customers found in matrix"**
- Check matrix file names match exactly
- Ensure matrix contains Customer_XXXXXXX format IDs

**"Team capacity exceeded"**
- System automatically redistributes overloaded teams
- Check for customers with very long service durations (300+ minutes)

**"VRP solver failed"**
- Normal for complex routing problems
- System falls back to sequential scheduling
- Still produces optimized geographic assignments

### **File Dependencies**
All required files are included in the repository. The large raw CSV files mentioned in older documentation are no longer needed - the system now uses the cleaned, optimized data files.
