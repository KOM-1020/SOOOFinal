# Fix for Your Current Local Package

## The Problem
Your npm installation failed due to conflicting Vite and Tailwind CSS versions.

## Quick Fix Commands

**In your current folder, run these commands:**

```bash
# Clear everything
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
cd client && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && cd ..

# Fix the dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cd client && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && cd ..

# Build and start
npm run build
npm start
```

**If that still fails, use the force method:**

```bash
# Force resolution
npm install --force
cd client && npm install --force && cd ..
npm run build
npm start
```

## Alternative: Use the Simple Package

The `tca-schedule-optimizer-simple.tar.gz` I created has no dependency conflicts:

1. Extract `tca-schedule-optimizer-simple.tar.gz`
2. Run `npm install` (no conflicts)
3. Run `npm start`
4. Opens at http://localhost:5000

This gives you the full Node.js application with all features but simplified dependencies.

## What You Get
- Complete Express.js backend
- Full React-equivalent frontend
- All 183 customer records

The simple version provides the same functionality as the complex one but without dependency management headaches.
